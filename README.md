# ChatbotsEmpatheticDialogues
In this data collection the folder 'questionnaires' contains tables that include all the questions from the questionnaires along with the responses received on August 13, 2023.
It also contains a summary table of the survey results and the graphical representation.

Furthermore, in the folder 'models' you will find the python code for the chatbots used to access the API.
For each questionnaire and chatbot, a separate text file was created. Each line within these files contains the instruction, answer options, and a question given by the questionnaire.
These lines are sequentially read one after the other and the chatbot generates a response for each line before processing to the next.
This approach effectively reduces the input length and complexity to assist the chatbot in better understanding the input.
